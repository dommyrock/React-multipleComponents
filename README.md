# React-multipleComponents
Multiple smaller components with React made for testing/learinng experience....

This is React/JS project that I started for fun in my free time to learn statefull , component based web architecture... 

App is more like "component library" ... most noticeable one is "UnsplashPhotos" which i made to render selected number of photos from external  "Unsplash API" in selected Quality with pre-made (Button renders) and custom search renders. 
I also added conditional render (that displays"HD"  Button on img elements) if img size === "thumb" (smallest size in api) . 
When "HD" Button is clicked -->selected image is than re-remdered in Full HD size.

Table +Chart rendering section:
Backend (API ) is set up only for dev/testing currently (hosted by "CsvFileUpload-MVC" App on ISS) and CORS is used, so those components wont render or have data in them until hosted localy.
